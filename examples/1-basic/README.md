__Basic Example__

In this example no external rendering or state manager library is used; it represents the most simplistic skeleton 
M*C app possible, only using the MVC architecture using event dispatching.

The example has two views; one home view with a button allowing the user to start a counting process and
a counter view that shows the counting. In the counter view the user can stop counting using a button, this will 
bring the app back in the home view.

This is not at all a realistic example because M*C is specifically created to allow to build and properly
structure large web applications. Further is does not show all the features M*C has to offer to create 
complex applications.
