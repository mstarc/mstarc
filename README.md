M*C : A web application framework that uses your rendering engine and state manager of choice.


**IN DEVELOPMENT**


To clone the M*C repo, including the corelib-web submodule, into new directory mstarc :

	git clone --recursive https://github.com/mstarc/mstarc.git mstarc

This framework uses [JSFace](https://github.com/tnhu/jsface) as Javascript OOP library

_Currently working on [usage examples](https://github.com/mstarc/mstarc/tree/master/examples)_
